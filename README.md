## Aims and Outcomes
1. Feel confident enough to take a more specialized Python Course, and contribute to a Hack Oregon Project.
2. Develop a lifelong love of programming.
3. Feel comfortable putting "proficient in Python" on your CV.
4. Read, undserstand, and write beautiful Python code.
5. Develop a Gitub Portfolio to show off what you've built.
6. Join the Hack Oregon community of professionals, students, events, and communications that will help your career and the state of Oregon.

## Core Principles
* **Learn by doing** - Project work and getting your hands dirty is essential to you learning to code. Each class period will be split between lecture and projects.
* **Learn from analogies** - Programming concepts can be complicated. Simple relatable examples will help you understand what you need to know
* **Learn to “Fish”** - Our course only lasts 8 weeks, and there’s no way to cover all of Python. I will teach you the skills to continue learning beyond “Python Foundations”
* **80/20** - “80% of the effect is from 20% of the causes” I’ll try to teach you the 20% that will give you 80% of the functionality of Python.

### Who is this course for?
* Beginners who have never programmed
* Programmers coming in from another language or refresh their Python
