## Aims and Outcomes
1. Feel confident enough to take a more specialized Python Course, and contribute to a Hack Oregon Project.
2. Develop a lifelong love of programming.
3. Feel comfortable putting "proficient in Python" on your CV.
4. Read, undserstand, and write beautiful Python code.
5. Develop a Gitub Portfolio to show off what you've built.
6. Join the Hack Oregon community of professionals, students, events, and communications that will help your career and the state of Oregon.

## Core Principles
* **Learn by doing** - Project work and getting your hands dirty is essential to you learning to code. Each class period will be split between lecture and projects.
* **Learn from analogies** - Programming concepts can be complicated. Simple relatable examples will help you understand what you need to know
* **Learn to “Fish”** - Our course only lasts 8 weeks, and there’s no way to cover all of Python. I will teach you the skills to continue learning beyond “Python Foundations”
* **80/20** - “80% of the effect is from 20% of the causes” I’ll try to teach you the 20% that will give you 80% of the functionality of Python.

### Who is this course for?
* Beginners who have never programmed
* Programmers coming in from another language or refresh their Python

# Curriculum Overview

- Lesson 0 - Setup
- Lesson 1 - Motivations/Background/Basic Data Types
- Lesson 2 - More Basic *Data Types*

## Specific Learning Outcomes 
(what you can tell your current/future employers)

Learn object/data structure basics, Basic opperators,statements, methods and functions, Object Oreinted Programming, Errors and Exception Handling, Using/Creating Modules, built-in Functions, decorators, generators. Also, include instruction on getting "unstuck" in the process of learning to fish. Create a project that builds upon your knowledge throughout, and use Git/GitHub to display your work.

### Certificate of Completion
Certificates are distributed via an open sourced badging program, [badgr.io](http://www.badgr.io), which is compliant with [Mozilla Open Badges](http://openbadges.org/) the current industry recgognized leader for verifiable digital credentials.

#### Grading Policy
Badges will be issued based upon attendance and participation in class. No more than 3 absences will be allowed, no more than 2 being unexcused. If you must miss class, please contact me, and we'll schedule a time to catch you up.

## Python 2 vs Python 3
> "Short version: Python 2.x is legacy, Python 3.x is the present and future of the language"

[source](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3)
#### Python 2
* Came out in 2000
* The latest version 2.7 was released in 2010
* Will lose support in 2020

#### Python 3
* Was released in 2008
* More libraries are beginning to support python 3, but not all (good way to contribute to open source)

#### Which will we choose?

#### Both! ...sort of
* We'll use 2.7, since if you were going to get a job today, that's likely what you'd be using
* Organizations still have Python 2 in code base, which means if you were to get hired tomorrow, you'd likely have to program in 2.7

#### Can I still learn 3?
* We will teach you the effective differences along the way, so you'll recognize and be able to code in python 3, and how to convert python 2 to 3
