[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - Forget using Finder. Launch applications and find files on your computer or on the web. Windows users, there is an option called [Launchy](http://www.launchy.net/), but I'm not sure if it's still supported and can't vouch for it.

[Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) - Window control with simple and customizable keyboard shortcuts

[Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) - My favorite editor. I haven't done much shopping around, but it has gotten the job done for me so far. Other popular Text Editors/ IDEs are:

* [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) - built into Macs/Linux, and can be downloaded on Windows. A little daunting for the new programmer, and definitely not recommended. It's a text editor built into the command line. Check it out if you're curious

* Spyder - loaded with anaconda's distribution. Find the app called "Navigator," and you should be able to open it from there.

* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - Popular IDE made specifically for Python

* [Atom.io](https://atom.io/) - Another popular IDE

* [WingWare](https://wingware.com/) - Another IDE made specifically for python
